-->  Warning: apt-key is deprecated. Manage key-ring files in trusted.gpg.d instead (see apt-key(8))  <--



- apt-keys are stored in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d


THEORY :

Installing a package from an external repository in Ubuntu consists of three steps:
   - Adding the repository’s GPG key to the system
   - Adding the external repository to the system
   - Installing the package from this external repository
   
- ‘apt-key being deprecated’ warning is when you try installing packages from third-party repositories.
- It’s a warning, not an error. It doesn’t stop the process. The GPG key is added to your system and you can continue adding the external repository.

-> Understanding the apt-key deprecation and trusted.gpg issue

   There are two parts to this message:
   	- apt-key is deprecated
   	- Manage keyring files in trusted.gpg.d

   When you add the keys (.gpg or .asc) of a repository, your system trusts the packages (signed with that key) coming from the repository. If you 
   don’t add the key of a repository, your system won’t allow installing packages from it.

-> Problem with the way apt-key works

   It works by adding the keys to the /etc/apt/trusted.gpg file. The apt package manager trusts the keys inside this file.

-> Ubuntu/Debian Linux wants you to separate GPG keys
   
   Ubuntu doesn’t want you to add all the signature keys in the single /etc/apt/trusted.gpg file. It suggests using a separate file that are located in 
   the /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d directory.



SOLUTION - 01:

1. This means that instead of using the apt-key in this fashion:
> curl -sS https://download.spotify.com/debian/pubkey_5E3C45D7B312C643.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

You should use it like this:
> curl -sS https://download.spotify.com/debian/pubkey_5E3C45D7B312C643.gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/spotify.gpg

Which is basically adding the key to its dedicated file under /etc/apt/trusted.d directory. Ubuntu won’t complain anymore.



SOLUTION - 02:

1. Export the GPG key from the deprecated keyring and store it in /usr/share/keyrings.
> sudo apt-key list                 # list apt-keys

2. Find the key giving warnings to export 
          sudo apt-key export BE1229CF | sudo gpg --dearmour -o /usr/share/keyrings/microsoft.gpg
Note: The BE1229CF value comes from the last 8 characters of the pub code

3. Update our apt source file for the repository (e.g., /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft.list), adding a signed-by tag:
> deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/edge/ stable main

4. Update apt to confirm the message is gone
> sudo apt update

5. Remove the original signature
> sudo apt-key del BE1229CF



SOLUTION - 03:

1. Change directory to apt
> cd /etc/apt

2. Copy the content of trusted.gpg to trusted.gpg.d directory
> sudo cp trusted.gpg trusted.gpg.d
