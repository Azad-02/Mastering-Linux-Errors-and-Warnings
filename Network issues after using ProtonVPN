Wifi shows active connection to a network but Internet doesn't work neither in browser nor in Command Line.

This issue generally occurs due to ipv6leak-protection of protonvpn.

Solution:

nmcli device                  # shows active network connections in device, if it shows pvpn-ipv6leak-protection or pvpn-killswitch, use commands

nmcli connection delete pvpn-killswitch
nmcli connection delete pvpn-ipv6leak-protection

> Internet is back
